  <h1>Where2Help</h1>
  <body>Where2Help was created in the winter of 2021 by Nathan Fazzone. The goal of the webpage is to help people who want to give back find worthy charities. The charities are organized into 6 categories. Those categories consist of the different “genres” of charities: Community Development, Education Charities, Environmental Charities, Health Charities, and Human Services. Each category comes with a summary of the different types of work and the goals of these charities. Along with these 6 categories the page contains a “Spotlight” section which features charities that are more focused on issues that are currently in the news. <body>
